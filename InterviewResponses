It lets you added nested routes without needing to duplicate the code for a slightly different URL.  For example, you can have a website.com/about/employee1/employee-details URL and website.com/about/employee2/employee-details --> employee-details code doesn't need to be duplicated.

2. How would you explain form validation to someone who has never programmed before?
